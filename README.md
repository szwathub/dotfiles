This is a collection of vim, git, Xcode, and fish configurations.

## Installation
__Warning__: If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove or change things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. And then use at your own computer!


You will need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools before continuing.
